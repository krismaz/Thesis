# Thesis
My master's thesis on algorithm engineering in the context of data-oblivious sorting.

It covers a wide range of algorithms, some classic sorting networks, and some newer data-oblivious random sorters.

Looking at running time, instruction count, cache misses, and branch mispredictions, algorithms are augmented using CUDA, OpenMP, and SSE, I attempt to make some interesting observations on the state of data-oblivious sorting.

Also, a small tool for flattening sorting networks is included

See Tex/thesis.pdf for the actual thesis.
