Pratt's Shellsort & $\Theta(n \log^2 n)$ & 0 & High \\

Shaker Sort & $\Theta(n \log n)$ & ? \tablefootnote{Failure rate is dependent on input permutations, and mostly verified experimentally, but low in practice with random input data.} & High\\

Due to the high number of algorithms present in this thesis, we provide a table listing the different algorithms used in the experiments, and their properties. 

One thing that is painfully obvious from Table~\ref{AlgTable} is the lack of an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm with 0 failure rate. Such algorithms do exist, as explained in the introduction of this thesis, but are both impractical to implement, and have horrible constant factors involved in their running times.
