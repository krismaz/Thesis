I'd like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Gerth Stølting Brodal for his guidance and helpful comments along the writing process.

I'd like to thank my fellow students Jan Knudsen and Roland Larsen, for their patience whenever I would rant incessantly in the office.

A big thank you to Søren Sørensen for keeping the Wednesday  homework session alive.

Thank you to my parents, without their continued support I'd have lost my mind long before even beginning my thesis.
