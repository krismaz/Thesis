I'd like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Gerth St√∏lting Brodal for his guidance and helpful comments along the writing process.

I'd like to thank my fellow students Jan Knudsen and Roland Larsen, for their patience whenever I would rant incessantly in the office.

Thank you to my parents, without their continued support, I'd have lost my mind long before even beginning my thesis.
